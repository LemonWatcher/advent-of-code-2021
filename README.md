# Advent of Code 2020

My repository of solutions to [2021's advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021), in Clojure.

## Structure

Each namespace is named for a day, tests are kept alongside solutions,
and Marginalia docs are built and hosted on [GitHub
pages](https://lemonwatcher.github.io/advent-of-code-2021/).
